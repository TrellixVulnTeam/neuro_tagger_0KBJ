15.1.6 Industry  Standards.    As  mentioned,  despite  the  large  number  of  installations  world-wide,  PC  pumps  and  drive  systems  do  not,  in  general,  conform  to  any  industry  standards  or common specifications. As a result, there is significant variation in the products available from different vendors, which generally precludes interchangeability of equipment components. The nomenclature  (e.g.,  naming  conventions,  ratings)  used  in  conjunction  with  both  pumps  and drive units also varies considerably, which can make it difficult for users to easily compare and select  products  from  different  suppliers.  Nevertheless,  there  have  been  some  recent  efforts  to develop industry standards for PCP systems.
