To  a  good  approximation,  P / T  conditions  for  LW-H-V  of  the  pure  components  in  Table 11.7  lie  on  a  straight  line  between  Q1  and  Q2,  on  a  semilogarithmic  plot  (ln  p  vs.  1 / Ta).  As discussed  below  in  the  Hand  Calculations  of  Hydrate  Formation  Conditions  section,  there  is no simple way to expand the above pure lines into that for a mixture, though there are several ways to hand-calculate LW-H-V conditions (P / T) for mixed hydrocarbon hydrate formers.
